# Wan 2.2 T2V 14B Model Binder Demo

This Binder setup attempts to run the **QuantStack/Wan2.2-T2V-A14B-GGUF** model from Hugging Face.

тЪая╕П **Note:** Binder gives only ~2 GB RAM and no GPU, so this demo will almost certainly crash or fail to load the model.
The goal here is to show *how* you would configure Binder for a large Hugging Face model.
